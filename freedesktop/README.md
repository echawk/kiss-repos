# freedesktop

This repo is meant to contain much of the software that is distributed
through freedesktop.org

Some notable highlights:

* accountservice
* dbus
* elogind
* polkit
* zeitgeist

It's important to note that this repo will not package everything that is
on the freedesktop.org site, since that would include wayland & X11, but
instead seeks to provide the much maligned components of freedesktop that
have become ever more pervasive in the Linux sphere.
